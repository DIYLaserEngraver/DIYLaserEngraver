## Preamble

This license has been extended from the MIT License to provide further details
on potential hazards of operating the device, and resistricts the copyright
author's liability in the case of device malfunction causing hazards
described in the hazards section of the document.

The following sections in this Preamble will describe additional terms used
in this license.

### Terms

**Device**: The laser engraver.

### Hazards

Due to the nature of the software-hardware package, potential sources of
damage are present. **Please read through these hazards carefully.**

#### High Voltage

**Laser Engravers are high-voltage (AC Mains) devices.**
Electric shock is possible during operation of the device. Contact with water
may cause electric shock. Do not touch exposed electronics operating on
the 230V AC Line. *The 24/12V DC rail and 5V DC rail, while lower voltage, light*
*electric shock can still ensue, albeit less dangerous.*

#### Heat/Fire

**Laser Engravers heats up surfaces to high temperature and can cause fire.**
While Marlin is designed to prevent thermal runaway, fires can still occur
to the nature of Laser Engravers. The finished products will have smoke
detectors which will automatically shut down the machine in case of a fire,
however there is no guarantee that the safety devices used to prevent long-
term fire pervention will functions, and it is still recommended to keep an
eye on the device during regular operation.

#### Lasers

**Laser Engravers can cause eye damage if handled improperly.**
Laser Engravers use lasers to embed images in metal and other surfaces,
if handled improperly, lasers can cause permanent eye damage if looked
directly in the eyes, from a reflection, or on a surface, increasing
order of power. When constructing the device, use laser safety goggles
rated for the laser you are using. (And also, if you can, check if the
laser safety goggles you have work. Laser safety goggles may appear
rated and safe, but some of them aren't.)
